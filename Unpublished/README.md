This folder contains unpublished mods.

These mods may be incomplete, not well tested, has serious side effects, or deemed to have low production value.

Dlls are usually distributed on Discord, if at all.
The best way to get the dll is to compile them yourself.

1. Make sure the game is installed in `C:\Program Files\Epic Games\PhoenixPoint`.  The mods need to reference it.
2. Download Visual Studio 2019, select ".Net Desktop Development" in the Installer.
3. Download the [https://github.com/Sheep-y/PhoenixPt-Mods/archive/master.zip whole repo] and extract to a folder.
4. Double click `PhoenixPt_Mods.sln`.  This should open all the mods in Visual Studio.
5. In Build menu, click "Build Solution".  You need to be online, and it may take a while.
6. If everthing is fine, you can find the mods in the `distro` folder.

If things are not fine, well, chances are you need to be a programmer to solve it.
I am sorry that I can't help here.
