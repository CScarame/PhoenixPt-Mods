# Sheepy's Phoenix Point Mods

*Source Codes* of my mods for [Phoenix Point](https://phoenixpoint.info/), [Snapshot Games](http://www.snapshotgames.com/) 2019.
No dlls here.
Download dlls from NexusMods, links below.

Unless otherwise noted, my mods tries not to modify game data,
meaning they shouldn't taint your save.
In other words, savegames made with the mods active should be safe to load when the mods are disabled.

Mods will be added as they are updated and optimised for [Modnix](https://github.com/Sheep-y/Modnix).

Some [unpublished mods](https://github.com/Sheep-y/PhoenixPt-Mods/tree/master/Unpublished) not found on NexusMods,
usually custom jobs or for self use, can be found here.

## List of Mods

Published mods only 

* [**Debug Console**](https://www.nexusmods.com/phoenixpoint/mods/44/) - Enable console and direct unity log and game log to it.
* [**Limited War**](https://www.nexusmods.com/phoenixpoint/mods/24) - Tone down the scale and damage of faction war.
* [**Scrap Vehicle**](https://www.nexusmods.com/phoenixpoint/mods/26) - Make it possible to recycle vehicles and mutogs.
* [**Skip Intro**](https://www.nexusmods.com/phoenixpoint/mods/17) - Skip logos, openings, and landings.
* [**UI Tweaks**](https://www.nexusmods.com/phoenixpoint/mods/13) - Enhance Geoscape pausing and centering.

## Loader Compatibility

All published mods are tested with [Modnix](https://github.com/Sheep-y/Modnix),
and should be compatible with [PPML v0.1](https://github.com/RealityMachina/PhoenixPointModInjector/#readme).

All my mods are *incompatible* with [PPML v0.2](https://github.com/Ijwu/PhoenixPointModLoader/#readme) found on [NexusMods](https://www.nexusmods.com/phoenixpoint/mods/38).
Because of how PPML v0.2 is designed, mods must choose one to support.

* 0.1 mods will be ignored by 0.2.
* 0.2 mods will *crash* PPML 0.1.

Since 0.1 is still used by old mods, and many players are not experts in mod management,
I opt for having my mods not work rather than crashing the game, when they are used incorrectly.
Thanks for your understanding.

## Tech Tree

Yup, I made the first complete tech tree for Phoenix Point.
Visit [Fandom wiki](https://phoenixpoint.fandom.com/) for [the image](https://phoenixpoint.fandom.com/wiki/File:Sheepy_Tech_Tree.gif).

The source code of my tech tree is in the [Tech Tree folder](https://github.com/Sheep-y/PhoenixPt-Mods/tree/master/TechTree).
It is charted with [UMLet](https://www.umlet.com/). SVG available.
Yeah.
Was supposed to be a draft.
Except that I have no plan to properly redo it.
Feel free to pick it up and carry on.
