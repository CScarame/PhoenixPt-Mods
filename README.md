## Tech Tree

The source code of my tech tree is in the Tech Tree folder.
Visit [Fandom wiki](https://phoenixpoint.fandom.com/) for [the image](https://phoenixpoint.fandom.com/wiki/File:Sheepy_Tech_Tree.gif).

It is charted with [UMLet](https://www.umlet.com/).
Yeah.
Was supposed to be a draft.
Except that I have no plan to properly redo it.
Feel free to pick up where I left.
