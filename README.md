# Sheepy's Phoenix Point Mods

*Source Codes* of my mods for [Phoenix Point](https://phoenixpoint.info/), [Snapshot Games](http://www.snapshotgames.com/) 2019.
(No dlls here.)

Unless otherwise noted, my mods tries their best to not modify game data,
meaning they shouldn't taint your save.
In other words, savegames made with the mods active should be safe to load when the mods are disabled.

Mods will be added as they are updated to be [Modnix](https://github.com/Sheep-y/Modnix) compatible.

Some unpublished not found on [NexusMods](https://www.nexusmods.com/phoenixpoint/mods/?BH=1), usually custom jobs, can be found here.

Unless otherwise specified, everything is released to the Public Domain.

## Tech Tree

Yup, I made the first complete tech tree for Phoenix Point.
Visit [Fandom wiki](https://phoenixpoint.fandom.com/) for [the image](https://phoenixpoint.fandom.com/wiki/File:Sheepy_Tech_Tree.gif).

The source code of my tech tree is in the [Tech Tree folder](https://github.com/Sheep-y/PhoenixPt-Mods/tree/master/TechTree).
It is charted with [UMLet](https://www.umlet.com/). SVG available.
Yeah.
Was supposed to be a draft.
Except that I have no plan to properly redo it.
Feel free to pick it up and carry on.
