# Sheepy's Phoenix Point Mods

*Source Codes* of my mods for [Phoenix Point](https://phoenixpoint.info/), [Snapshot Games](http://www.snapshotgames.com/) 2019.
No dlls here.
Download dlls from NexusMods, links below.

Unless otherwise noted, my mods tries not to modify game data,
meaning they shouldn't taint your save.
In other words, savegames made with the mods active should be safe to load when the mods are disabled.

Mods will be added as they are updated to be [Modnix](https://github.com/Sheep-y/Modnix) compatible.

Some [unpublished mods](https://github.com/Sheep-y/PhoenixPt-Mods/tree/master/Unpublished) not found on NexusMods,
usually custom jobs or for self use, can be found here.

## List of Mods

Published mods only 

* **Skip Intro** - Skip logos, openings, and landings.
* * https://www.nexusmods.com/phoenixpoint/mods/17

## PPML Compatibility

All published mods works with both [PPML v0.1](https://github.com/RealityMachina/PhoenixPointModInjector/#readme) and [Modnix](https://github.com/Sheep-y/Modnix),
and are released to the Public Domain.

All my mods are *incompatible* with [PPML v0.2](https://github.com/Ijwu/PhoenixPointModLoader/#readme) found on [NexusMods](https://www.nexusmods.com/phoenixpoint/mods/38).
Because of how PPML v0.2 is designed, mods must choice one to support.

* 0.1 mods will be ignored by 0.2.
* 0.2 mods will *crash* PPML 0.1.

Since 0.1 is still used by old mods, and many players are not experts in mod management,
I opt for having my mods not work rather than crashing the game, when they are used incorrectly.

Could have make two versions for each and every mods, of course.
But I'd rather spend time on mods and tools, than supporting a tool that back itself into a corner and is not being updated.

Thanks for your understanding.

## Tech Tree

Yup, I made the first complete tech tree for Phoenix Point.
Visit [Fandom wiki](https://phoenixpoint.fandom.com/) for [the image](https://phoenixpoint.fandom.com/wiki/File:Sheepy_Tech_Tree.gif).

The source code of my tech tree is in the [Tech Tree folder](https://github.com/Sheep-y/PhoenixPt-Mods/tree/master/TechTree).
It is charted with [UMLet](https://www.umlet.com/). SVG available.
Yeah.
Was supposed to be a draft.
Except that I have no plan to properly redo it.
Feel free to pick it up and carry on.
