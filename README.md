# Sheepy's Phoenix Point Mods

*Source Codes* of my mods for [Phoenix Point](https://phoenixpoint.info/), [Snapshot Games](http://www.snapshotgames.com/) 2019.
No dlls here.
Download dlls from NexusMods, links below.

Unless otherwise noted, my mods tries not to modify game data,
meaning they shouldn't taint your save.
In other words, savegames made with the mods active should be safe to load when the mods are disabled.

Mods will be added as they are updated to be [Modnix](https://github.com/Sheep-y/Modnix) compatible.

Some [unpublished mods](https://github.com/Sheep-y/PhoenixPt-Mods/tree/master/Unpublished) not found on NexusMods,
usually custom jobs or for self use, can be found here.

All published mods works with both [PPML v0.1](https://github.com/RealityMachina/PhoenixPointModInjector/#readme) and [Modnix](https://github.com/Sheep-y/Modnix),
and are released to the Public Domain.

## Tech Tree

Yup, I made the first complete tech tree for Phoenix Point.
Visit [Fandom wiki](https://phoenixpoint.fandom.com/) for [the image](https://phoenixpoint.fandom.com/wiki/File:Sheepy_Tech_Tree.gif).

The source code of my tech tree is in the [Tech Tree folder](https://github.com/Sheep-y/PhoenixPt-Mods/tree/master/TechTree).
It is charted with [UMLet](https://www.umlet.com/). SVG available.
Yeah.
Was supposed to be a draft.
Except that I have no plan to properly redo it.
Feel free to pick it up and carry on.
