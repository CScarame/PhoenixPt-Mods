# Sheepy's Phoenix Point Mods

*Source Codes* of my mods for [Phoenix Point](https://phoenixpoint.info/), [Snapshot Games](http://www.snapshotgames.com/) 2019.
(No dlls here.)

Mods will be added as they are updated to [Modnix](https://github.com/Sheep-y/Modnix) compatible.

Some unpublished not found on [NexusMods](https://www.nexusmods.com/phoenixpoint/mods/?BH=1), usually custom jobs, can be found here.

Unless otherwise specified, everything is released to the Public Domain.

## Tech Tree

Yup, I made the first complete tech tree for Phoenix Point.
Visit [Fandom wiki](https://phoenixpoint.fandom.com/) for [the image](https://phoenixpoint.fandom.com/wiki/File:Sheepy_Tech_Tree.gif).

The source code of my tech tree is in the [Tech Tree folder](https://github.com/Sheep-y/PhoenixPt-Mods/tree/master/TechTree).
It is charted with [UMLet](https://www.umlet.com/). SVG available.
Yeah.
Was supposed to be a draft.
Except that I have no plan to properly redo it.
Feel free to pick it up and carry on.
